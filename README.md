JavaMelody : monitoring of JavaEE applications
=========================

The goal of JavaMelody is to monitor Java or Java EE application servers in QA and production environments.

It is not a tool to simulate requests from users,
it is a tool to measure and calculate statistics on real operation of an application depending on the usage of the application by users.

JavaMelody is mainly based on statistics of requests and on evolution charts.
It allows to improve applications in QA and production and helps to:
- give facts about the average response times and number of executions
- make decisions when trends are bad, before problems become too serious
- optimize based on the more limiting response times
- find the root causes of response times
- verify the real improvement after optimizations
