Compilation and development of Java Melody : monitoring d'applications Java EE

	({{{dev_guide_en.html} English }})

* Building from sources

	The zip file available in "Download" contains the java sources with an ant script build.xml and a pom.xml file for maven
	and contains also the javadoc, the eclipse project, the jar files.
	If you want to rebuild the development version, you have to do an anonymous checkout from 
	http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javamelody-core/ (with Eclipse or with TortoiseSVN if Windows)

	You can use the "all" target of the ant script (without maven) to recompile from sources
	and to build the javamelody.jar and javamelody.war files which are those available in "Download".
	You must use a JDK 1.6 to compile the sources.

	You can also use the maven goals "clean site" to build a maven site with documentations and reports on analysis of sources
	or on unit tests (checkstyle, findbugs, pmd, cpd, junit, cobertura).

* Development

	The development is done with Eclipse in its latest version and with the jdk 1.6 at least for compilation.
	
	The manager of sources is Subversion at
	
	{{{http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}http://javamelody.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}

	The charset of files is UTF-8. The Eclipse configuration is supplied in sources with the configuration of
	code formater, clean-up, warnings and of checkstyle, pmd, findbugs and lint4j plugins.
	The infinitest eclipse plugin is also recommended.
