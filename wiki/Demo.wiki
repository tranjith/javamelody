  * Then you can view the charts and the statistics in the [http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring monitoring reports] (no password)
  * Or you can view the same monitoring reports in the [http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring?part=jnlp Rich Desktop Application] (JavaWebStart, requires JRE 1.7)
