The public demo of JavaMelody was running free thanks to <a href='http://www.cloudbees.com/'>CloudBees</a> RUN@Cloud. Unfortunately, CloudBees has <a href='https://www.cloudbees.com/faq-customers-runcloud'>shut down</a> RUN@Cloud, including this demo. So the demo is not available online anymore.

If you know where to restart the demo (freely if possible), please send a message to the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/javamelody users' group].

CloudBees DEV@Cloud is still providing [ContinuousIntegration continuous integration] and nightly builds.
