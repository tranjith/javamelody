A Grails Melody plugin was released by Liu Chao at http://www.grails.org/plugin/grails-melody to integrate JavaMelody in Grails (Groovy on rails). 

=== 1.10.0 ===

  * fix: added automatic monitoring of jdbc datasources when their jndi names starts with java:/jdbc like when they starts with java:comp/env/jdbc (for jboss for example)
  * change: default language is now English. To help people outside US, UK and France: the language of the UI is always based on the language of the browser if a translation is found (just 'fr' for now), or now on the language of the java server if a translation is found, or to the default translation (that is now English). 
  * added: [UserGuideAdvanced documentation] to setup JavaMelody in an EAR file (based on a contribution by 'dhartford')
  * added: [DevGuide documentation] to import current development sources in eclipse
  * added: memory overhead estimated in reports

=== 1.9.0 ===

  * fix issue 3 "http status 500" : NoSuchElementException in getPID on Solaris 10
  * fix for use of JavaMelody in tomcat's lib directory without modification of monitored webapps (fix NullPointerException in dbcp datasource), [UserGuideAdvanced#Deployment_on_Tomcat_without_modification_of_monitored_webapps documentation] added
  * added: display of availability or unavailability of applications in the collect server
  * added: [UserGuideAdvanced documentation] for monitoring of services without ejb3 and without spring

=== 1.8.2 ===

  * fix ClassCastException for ehcache v1.2.1 to v1.2.4 (thanks hl)
  * fix: c:\... is now an absolute path for parameter "storage-directory" (and not relative to temp)
  * sql monitoring by jdbc datasource can now be disabled by an empty "datasources" parameter
  * added: display of deadlocks between threads if there are
This is the same version of JavaMelody as in the hudson plugin "[http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Monitoring Monitoring]" available in [http://hudson-ci.org/ hudson].

=== 1.8.0 ===

  * fix for container authentication on the report (thanks hasalex)
