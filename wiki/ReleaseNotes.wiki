=== 1.14.0 ===

  * fix: Use *spring datasources* in some parts of the reports, if of course the monitoring-spring.xml file (with the post-processor) is used as said in the [UserGuide#7._JDBC user guide]. Like with jndi datasources, database version and jdbc driver version will be displayed. And if system actions are enabled, reports on the database will be available (like mysql variables and process list, or oracle long requests).
  * fix issue 16: InternalError "Unable to open directory /proc/self/fd" on ubuntu or debian using jsvc
  * fix in the javamelody plugin for atlassian (jira, bamboo, confluence): better aggregation of http URLs and less memory overhead in jira and in bamboo (the parameter "http-transform-pattern" has been changed in the atlassian plugin from "-\d+" to "-\d+|chment/.+|onent/.+|est/.+|ifact/.+" for attachment, component, test, artifact)
  * added with help from _Pether SÃ¶rling_: If *Logback* is available, warn logs are automatically monitored in order to display them in reports like with log4j and with java.util.logging, and Logback is used for log of http requests.
  * added: if system actions are enabled, display of stack traces of where were opened jdbc connections, in order to help *find jdbc connection leaks*

=== 1.13.0 ===

  * fix issue 14: html reports in utf-8 for cyrillic and other characters
  * fix issue 15: support for log4j-over-slf4j 
  * added: remember the last selected period (with a persistent cookie in the browser)
  * added: UI option to display graphs and statistics for *custom periods*, via fields of start and end dates of period to display (from user group)

=== 1.12.0 ===

  * if a centralized collect server is used:
    * fix issue 12: workaround for a bug in Winstone (standalone mode)
    * fix issue 13: NoClassDefFoundError with ehcache in the collect server if the monitored application uses ehcache
  * added: If Oracle database, display of *sql execution plan* in sql request detail (seems not doable if postgresql or mysql, without particular parameter values)
  * added: *New charts* "Threads count", "Loaded classes count", "Used non heap memory", "Used physical memory", "Used swap space" (displayed with the new link "Other charts")
  * added: spring post-processor in net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring.xml to auto-detect datasources defined in a spring xml file.
  * added: If quartz is available in classpath, display of the *list of the [http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/ quartz] jobs* with date and hour of previous execution, date and hour of next execution, duration of running jobs and buttons to pause and to resume all jobs or each job
  * added: Button to kill a java thread
  * added: New parameter {{{monitoring-path}}} to change the url "/monitoring" of the report to "/admin/monitoring" for example (from user group)

=== Atlassian JIRA plugin ===

A beta version of a JIRA plugin is released now to integrate JavaMelody in Atlassian JIRA.
See [UserGuide] for installation.

This plugin has been tested with a JIRA 4.0.1 server, but it certainly works with Confluence and Bamboo.

=== 1.11.1 ===

  * fix for AssertionError in sql counter when assertions are enabled (in maven surefire for example)
  * if a centralized collect server is used:
    * fix: after an action like GC is called do not execute the action again and again when the page is refreshed with the action parameter in the url
    * added: display of a message to say what was done after an action is called
  * added: in sql or spring or ejb request detail, link to display the reversed call-tree (i.e. usages) of the request
  * added: parameters can now be specified in environment variables like in system properties, webapp context or as init-param of MonitoringFilter
  * added: if postgresql, display of pg_locks, pg_tablespace, pg_database and of cachehitratio in pg_stat_database
  * added: if ehcache, an action is available to clear all caches of all cache managers
  * added: extraction of "maxActive" and other properties from apache dbcp BasicDataSource like what is already extracted from apache tomcat BasicDataSource (as discussed in user group)
  * added: new parameter "mail-periods" to change the period of mail reports from weekly to daily or monthly or a combination of the 3 (as suggested in user group)
  * added: display the version of JavaMelody at the bottom of the html and pdf reports (as suggested in user group)
  * added: [UserGuideAdvanced#Usage_of_in_JonAS_5_(which_uses_OSGI) documentation] to use JavaMelody in JonAS 5
  * added: display of "ajax GET" or "ajax POST" in http requests names for ajax requests
(same as of version 1.11.0 except for a java assertion which has no impact in general)

=== Grails Melody plugin ===

A Grails Melody plugin was released by Liu Chao at http://www.grails.org/plugin/grails-melody to integrate JavaMelody in Grails (Groovy on rails). 

=== 1.10.0 ===

  * fix: added automatic monitoring of jdbc datasources when their jndi names starts with java:/jdbc like when they starts with java:comp/env/jdbc (for jboss for example)
  * change: default language is now English. To help people outside US, UK and France: the language of the UI is always based on the language of the browser if a translation is found (just 'fr' for now), or now on the language of the java server if a translation is found, or to the default translation (that is now English). 
  * added: [UserGuideAdvanced documentation] to setup JavaMelody in an EAR file (based on a contribution by 'dhartford')
  * added: [DevGuide documentation] to import current development sources in eclipse
  * added: memory overhead estimated in reports

=== 1.9.0 ===

  * fix issue 3 "http status 500" : NoSuchElementException in getPID on Solaris 10
  * fix for use of JavaMelody in tomcat's lib directory without modification of monitored webapps (fix NullPointerException in dbcp datasource), [UserGuideAdvanced#Deployment_on_Tomcat_without_modification_of_monitored_webapps documentation] added
  * added: display of availability or unavailability of applications in the collect server
  * added: [UserGuideAdvanced documentation] for monitoring of services without ejb3 and without spring

=== 1.8.2 ===

  * fix ClassCastException for ehcache v1.2.1 to v1.2.4 (thanks hl)
  * fix: c:\... is now an absolute path for parameter "storage-directory" (and not relative to temp)
  * sql monitoring by jdbc datasource can now be disabled by an empty "datasources" parameter
  * added: display of deadlocks between threads if there are
This is the same version of JavaMelody as in the hudson plugin "[http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Monitoring Monitoring]" available in [http://hudson-ci.org/ hudson].

=== 1.8.0 ===

  * fix for sql monitoring : the sql requests were monitored only in tomcat when a jdbc datasource was used. Fix tested with tomcat v5.5 & v6, glassfish v3, jboss v5, weblogic v11g, jetty v6, jonas v5
  * fix for container authentication on the report (thanks hasalex)
