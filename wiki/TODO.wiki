== TODO list of features ==

Here is a list of wishes of features.

JavaMelody is opensource:
Priorities and todos may change any time.
There is no promise of dates or that a particular feature will ever be done.

  # Fix [http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/issues/list issues]
  # More unit tests
  # More integration tests (all JDK/JRE and versions, all OS, all application servers and versions, all navigators)
  # Translations (German, Italian, Spanish...)
  # Option in the UI to change from cumulative times (http times include sql) to *non-cumulative times*, or at least a parameter (from user group)
  # UI option to display graphs and statistics for yesterday or for the day before, via fields of *custom start and end dates of period to display* for example (from user group)
  # In sql detail, display of *sql explain plan* if Oracle (seems not doable if postgresql or mysql, without particular parameter values)
  # Replace GET or POST in http requests names by GWT if client is GWT (from user group), idem for AJAX GET or POST.
  # Downloadable *demo* of JavaMelody in [http://java.sun.com/developer/releases/petstore/ java pet store] with step by step instruction to install in glassfish for example
  # If quartz is available in classpath, display of the *list of the [http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/ quartz] jobs* with if possible date and hour of last execution, date and hour of next execution, frequency, mean execution times, mean cpu times, mean sql hits and times, buttons to launch and to freeze executions)
  # Simplify UI with [http://groups.google.fr/group/javamelody/browse_thread/thread/d4ac1b796e366852 user feedback]
  # Display of graphs with *percentages of navigators, of OS, of countries/languages* based on user-agent and main locale, with jrobin and percentage one above the others up to 100%, and idem with types of requests (get,post,ajax,gwt or perhaps select/update/insert/delete)
  # *Alerts* based on thresholds, with mails to administrators
  # *CSV* exports of tables
  # Rich *desktop UI* able to connect to multiple servers via CollectorServer and to centralized collect servers, with [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/ swing] and [http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp java web start]
  # *[http://munin.projects.linpro.no/ Munin]/[http://www.nagios.org/ Nagios]* plugin to display some graphs in those tools
  # Maven:
    # Why the *[http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html maven site]* of javamelody does not include findbugs and checkstyle in the [http://mojo.codehaus.org/dashboard-maven-plugin/ dashboard] ? (or why the findbugs and checkstyle plugins are executed after the dashboard plugin, if not with the looooonger "site dashboard:dashboard site" ?)
    # Why the dependencies part when building the maven site is so long when online ?
    # Why maven plugins (pmd, checkstyle, findbugs, dashboard...) are often years late ?
    # Why editing apt files in eclipse always freezes Eclipse ? (Eclipse 3.5, m2eclipse 0.9.8, maven embedded)
    # Why maven waits forever to build in Eclipse when I have forgotten to change the proxy in my settings.xml between my work day and my work night ? and why can't I cancel the waiting build ?
    # Display the *version* of JavaMelody (from [http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/browse/trunk/javamelody-core/pom.xml pom.xml]) in the html and pdf reports (from user group)
    # Publish JavaMelody in maven central repository (seems not doable without jrobin in central repo and without renaming package to googlecode)
  # More to come...
