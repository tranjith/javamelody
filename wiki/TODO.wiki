== TODO list of features ==

Here is a list of wishes of features.

JavaMelody is opensource:
Priorities and todos may change any time.
There is no promise of dates or that a particular feature will ever be done.

  # Fix [http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/issues/list issues]
  # More unit tests
  # More integration tests (all JDK/JRE and versions, all OS, all application servers and versions, all navigators)
  # *Translations* (German, Italian, Spanish...)
  # Option in the UI to change from cumulative times (http times include sql) to *non-cumulative times*, via a link and a persistent http cookie or at least a parameter (from user group)
  # Replace "POST" in http requests names by *"GWT-RPC"* and extract class and method names from the gwt payload for gwt-rpc requests (from user group)
  # Downloadable *demo* of JavaMelody in [http://java.sun.com/developer/releases/petstore/ java pet store] with step by step instruction to install in glassfish for example
  # Simplify UI with [http://groups.google.fr/group/javamelody/browse_thread/thread/d4ac1b796e366852 user feedback]
  # Display of graphs with *percentages of navigators, of OS, of countries/languages* based on user-agent and main locale, with jrobin and percentage one above the others up to 100%, and idem with types of requests (get,post,ajax,gwt or perhaps select/update/insert/delete)
  # *Alerts* based on thresholds, with mails to administrators
  # *CSV* exports of tables
  # Rich *desktop UI* able to connect to multiple servers via CollectorServer and to centralized collect servers, with [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/ swing] and [http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp java web start]
  # *[http://munin.projects.linpro.no/ Munin]/[http://www.nagios.org/ Nagios]* plugin to display some graphs in those tools
  # Maven:
    # Why the *[http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html maven site]* of javamelody does not include findbugs and checkstyle in the [http://mojo.codehaus.org/dashboard-maven-plugin/ dashboard] ? (or why the findbugs and checkstyle plugins are executed after the dashboard plugin, if not with the looooonger "site dashboard:dashboard site" ?) (maven 2.2)
    # Why the dependencies part when building the maven site is so long (in minutes) when online ?
    # Regressions with maven checkstyle plugin, [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCHECKSTYLE-133 MCHECKSTYLE-133]
    # And why maven plugins (pmd, checkstyle, findbugs, dashboard...) are often years late ?
    # Why editing apt files in eclipse always freezes Eclipse ? (Eclipse 3.5, m2eclipse 0.9.8, maven embedded)
    # Why maven waits forever to build in Eclipse when I have forgotten to change the proxy in my settings.xml between my work day and my work night ? and why can't I cancel the waiting build ?
    # Publish JavaMelody in maven central repository (seems not doable without jrobin in central repo and without renaming package to googlecode)
  # More to come...
