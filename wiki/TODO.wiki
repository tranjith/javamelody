== TODO list of features ==

Here is a list of wishes of features

  # Fix [http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/issues/list issues]
  # More unit tests
  # More integration tests (all JDK and versions, all OS, all application servers and versions)
  # Option in the UI to change from cumulative times (http times include sql) to *non-cumulative times*, or at least a parameter (from user group)
  # Parameter (or UI option) to change the *period of mail reports* from weekly to daily or monthly or all these (from user group)
  # UI option to display graphs and statistics for yesterday or for the day before, via fields of *custom start and end dates of period to display* for example (from user group)
  # In sql detail, display of *sql explain plan* if Oracle (seems not doable if postgresql or mysql, without particular parameter values)
  # Downloadable *demo* of JavaMelody in [http://java.sun.com/developer/releases/petstore/ java pet store] with step by step instruction to install in glassfish for example
  # More to come...

JavaMelody is opensource:
Priority and todos may change any time.
There is no promise of dates or that a particular feature will ever be done.
